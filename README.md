### Notes
Initially when building the app I was unsure of how to change the column layout (until the last part of the guide.) I am still trying to adjust to pushing updates through Git as well.

### Notes
It was difficult to customize styling in iOS as the font options and styling of each table cell seem limited with my current knowledge in Swift. In addition, I had made changes to include the Launch Screen but my changes wouldn't be pushed into the repository- it took some time to figure it out through Xcode. HackMD wasn't also properly importing my GIF.
